# Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Workshop
This is an operations workshop with Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Join Pivotal and Shelter Insurance for a half-day hands-on workshop to introduce Pivotal Cloud Foundry and walk through installation and operations of the platform. The labs will leverage the CF CLI and Ops Manager.

## Agenda
# note here, let's link in the slides instead of later (in course materials)
Time | Session
---- | -------
8:00 AM - 8:15 AM | _Introduction by Shelter Insurance_

This is a _loose_ schedule for the day. We will adjust as necessary based on our pace through the material.

The lectures for this workshop are generally light and are only intended to set the stage for the hands-on labs.
The overwhelming majority of our time will be spent engaging with the technology directly!

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites
Start by downloading and installing the appropriate prerequisite tools.
- [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://goo.gl/M0pH4i) to interact with a cloud foundry instance
- [Apache Maven](http://info.pivotal.io/HI002010A6ZlRJR1NeU00eC) to build labs using Maven
- [Gradle](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.1-all.zip) to build labs using Gradle
- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone Github repo or download and unzip
- An IDE, like [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Java SE Development Kit](http://info.pivotal.io/n0I60i3021AN0JU0le10CRR)

### Download Materials
Next, download the course materials. This can be accomplished either through the GitHub website by downloading a repository zip and unzipping locally, or if you have Git installed, use the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/phopper-pivotal/PCF-Ops-Workshop-Shelter.git
$ cd PCF-Ops-Workshop-Shelter/
```

### PCF Environments
Finally, in order to perform the labs, you must be connected or logged into a live PCF environment. Initially you were asked to create a Pivotal Web Services (PWS) account for use in labs and afterwards. Two other environments have also been made available for use. Please see the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Environment document](Common/env_info.md) for details. You should have been assigned a student number and PCF instance at registration. Otherwise the instructors will provide that information for your use.
